# IPL-AUCTION-DASHBOARD
This project is a complete data analysis pipeline built to extract, clean, and visualize IPL Auction statistics. The process starts with web scraping auction data from the official IPL website, followed by data cleaning and exploration in Python. The cleaned datasets are then transformed into Excel for additional formatting and minor adjustments. Finally, the data is visualized and presented in an interactive Power BI dashboard using Power Query for advanced transformations.

Workflow

Data Extraction – Web scraped IPL Auction data from the official IPL website using Python.

Data Cleaning & Analysis – Used Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to clean, process, and create visualizations.

Excel Processing – Exported cleaned datasets to Excel for formatting, pivot tables, and minor value adjustments.

Dashboard Creation – Imported refined data into Power BI, applied advanced transformations in Power Query, and built interactive visual dashboards for insights.
